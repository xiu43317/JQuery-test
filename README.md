# JQuery-test
This project was designed for one of my familiar fabric manufacturers. I use JQuery to fullfill the animations and SPA. In addtion, I also use the php mail system to receieve customers' requirements automaticallly. You can find two mail.php inside this repository. mail.php is using php's mailto function and it tends to let the mail to be sent to spam. The other one is using gmail host to send email, this method is more reliable for users. As for the design, I use bootstrap4 and fontawesome to enrich my web scheme. JQuery also provides a varity of pakages for web developers. I use one of those packages called aos.js to customize my animations and w3schools also provides many fantanstic js animation to meet my needs.
